# Archivum — Secure Evidence Capture

Archivum is a privacy-first web application that helps individuals safely collect, organize, and document evidence of harassment, abuse, or misconduct. It enables users to compile screenshots, links, messages, and a chronological timeline into a structured incident report generated with AI assistance.

## 🧩 Project Description

Many people struggle to document harassment or abuse in a clear, organized, and credible way. Evidence is often scattered across chats, screenshots, and links, making it difficult to present a coherent account of events.

Archivum solves this problem by providing a simple, secure interface where users can collect all forms of evidence in one place and generate a factual, structured incident documentation PDF.

**Technologies used:**
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Vanilla JavaScript
- jsPDF (PDF generation)
- Google Gemini API (AI-generated documentation)

All processing happens client-side to maximize privacy and user control.

## 🎯 Purpose

The motivation behind Archivum is to reduce the emotional and technical burden of documenting difficult experiences. During stressful situations, organizing evidence should not be an additional obstacle.

Archivum matters because it:
- Encourages responsible documentation
- Protects user privacy by avoiding permanent storage
- Helps users present events clearly and chronologically

If developed further, Archivum could support survivors, students, employees, journalists, or activists by making evidence collection safer, clearer, and more accessible.
